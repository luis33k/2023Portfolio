			<p>I am delighted to share insights into the creation of my online portfolio, commonly referred to as an "E-Portfolio." In the following discussion, I will provide a detailed account of my experiences in programming, designing, and the substantial time investment devoted to bringing this project to fruition. Additionally, I will expound upon the valuable lessons acquired during this endeavor and how it augments my future endeavors, especially in my pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in web development.
			To commence, I would like to offer a succinct summary. The process of programming, coding, developing, and testing a website is an iterative journey that demands a considerable amount of time and effort. Acknowledging the imperfections inherent in any project, I, as a seasoned programmer with over six years of experience and a commitment to perfection, dedicated several weeks to meticulously crafting not only the HTML but also the CSS components of the website. The color scheme and overall design, inspired by a personal affinity for a pink/purple/white retro palette, were meticulously conceptualized.
			It is crucial to clarify that no templates were copied or downloaded for this project. Every aspect of programming, coding, and development was undertaken by me, utilizing Google Chrome and Notepad++. Daily testing and refinement, averaging over eight hours of work per day for a continuous four-week period, underscore the rigorous nature of this undertaking. Despite its challenges, my extensive experience and commitment to excellence, evident through my tenure as a respected tutor at North Broward College in Coconut Creek, fueled my passion to create a fully functional and bespoke website.
			This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. While much of the content was a review, the additional insights gained from LinkedIn videos and W3 assignments introduced novel practices that have proven invaluable in both my personal coding pursuits and my role as a hands-on tutor at Broward College.
			The inception of this project dates back at least a year, a testament to my ambition to craft a personalized portfolio hosted under my domain. The motivation was not only to showcase my programming prowess but also to convey to potential employers a dedicated approach to time and code management. My commitment to programming extends beyond this project, encompassing a continuous journey of learning and improvement in languages such as C++, Visual Basic, Python, and Java. I was able to have a deeper understanding of the language and a comprehensive review. This project I had in mind since atleast a year ago, where I thought I really wanted to code my own portfolio and host it under my own domain, so that I could use it on my resume and Linkdin to not only show my capabilties in programming, but also show employers that I am not playing around with my time or code. I take this practice seriously, I will continue programming all of my life. I enjoy coding and learning continuously I will do this till the day I go to heaven.
			The culmination of this effort is presented as my Portfolio—a testament to my coding abilities, design acumen, and productivity. Beyond personal gain, I aspire to utilize this platform to aid fellow students in my tutoring capacity, an ongoing commitment spanning four years. The project not only deepened my understanding of HTML5 and CSS but also afforded me the opportunity to explore new JavaScript techniques previously unexplored.
			The completion of the portfolio is a source of immense pride. The project involved not only programming for desktops but also rigorous testing and adaptation for mobile devices using Google Chrome's developer tools. The continuous improvement of websites and applications underscores the complexity of coding, reinforcing the importance of experienced programmers in this field.
			This journey also introduced me to new CSS techniques, such as the box-shadow property, and empowered me to create customized JavaScript functions, including one facilitating the opening of default email applications—an advanced and professional feature. The joy derived from coding is evident throughout my narrative, and I am eager to find a suitable web host to upload and showcase my portfolio.
			In conclusion, I express my profound gratitude for the knowledge gained during this class, emphasizing its impact on my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My portfolio, a culmination of these learnings, is not merely a project but a tangible manifestation of my dedication to coding. As I prepare to host it online, I extend my appreciation for taking the time to explore and experience my code. For any inquiries, please feel free to reach out to me via the provided work and student emails. Coding, to me, is not just a continuous process; it is an ongoing journey of learning and creation—one that I embrace with passion and dedication. Thank you, Professor, for the invaluable lessons. I truly love coding.
